Extends ClientScript to minify and pack registered assets. It uses the PHP port of Douglas Crockford's jsmin by rgrove (https://github.com/rgrove/jsmin-php).

##Requirements

I tested this extension with Yii 1.1.7 < but it should work from 1.1 onwards.

##Usage

Copy the folder into the extensions folder of your app. Than in the configuration file add the following section under components:
~~~
[php]
'clientScript' => array(
                        'class' => 'ext.ClientScriptPacker.ClientScriptPacker'
                ),
~~~
If this is done you can register your scriptfiles like you did before with Yii::app()->clientScript->registerScriptFile() and it will create the packed and minified javascript files in the assets folder. Your original JS files will stay untouched. If you want to re-pack the files just delete the files from your assets folder.
If you experience any problem please give me a shout.
